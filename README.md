# <div id="top">JS_Tiltoli</div>

This project was a school assignment. The goal was to create a `15 puzzle` game using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.

## Description

When you start the program, every cell, except the bottom right will be filled with a number. The numbers are unique, randomly generated from 1 to 15. You can change the position of a number by clicking on them if they neighbour a empty cell. The empty cell will get the number that is clicked on, and the previous cell will become empty. The goal is to sort the numbers from lowest to highest. When you are done, press the button.
